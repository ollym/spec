Open Booking Manifesto

We, the undersigned, want to standardise the APIs used to sell and exchange booking information in the entertainment, tourism and travel industry. We believe this is a critical step in creating a free and open marketplace, and enabling the next generation of digital experiences for the customer.

Today, every booking platform vendor has built independent APIs instead of adopting existing standards; despite much of the API functionality being fundamentally identical. We believe the main reasons behind this are the following:

1. Different platforms have varying data models and feature sets that are not immediately compatible with one another.
2. The market for booking platforms is competitive and collaboration is politically difficult.
3. It is hard to standardise because suppliers have varying business models.
4. Previous attempts at standards have been overly ambitious and ended up too complex.
5. The industry is very fragmented over many different time zones making it hard to communicate ideas and get significant traction.

It is therefore our goal to design an API specification that is:

1. Easy for anyone to get started with.
2. Flexible and inclusive of all booking platform vendors.
3. Democratised and open to contributions.
4. Free to integrate, and open source.
5. Led by developers, not business people.

Key to the long-term success of this standard will be to build a sustainable business model that does not corrupt our founding goals. Like all public-forum initiatives it's important to balance being inclusive with everyone's ideas whilst staying focussed and making progress. To that end we propose a steering group is formed to develop the specification.

To qualify to be a member of the steering group you must:

1. Be a developer capable of implementing the standard yourself.
2. Commit to implement the API specification within your own platform.
3. Publicly acknowledge support of the initiative and encouraging its use.
4. Regularly contribute new ideas, and provide feedback to others.
5. Agree to collaborate with all other members of the group without exception.
